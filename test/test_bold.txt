You can make things **bold** or //italic// or **//both//** or //**both**//.


Character formatting extends across line breaks: **bold,
this is still bold. This line deliberately does not end in star-star.

Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries.

And **
should be bold.
Just like this.
