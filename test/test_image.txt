This should be a flower with the ALT text "this is a flower" if your wiki supports ALT text on images:

{{Red_Flower.jpg|this is a flower}}

No alt text:
{{Red_Flower.jpg}}

Bold and italics in alt text.
{{Red_Flower.jpg|my **bold** flower is //italic//, **//oh, yeah//**}}

From [[wikicreole.org]]
{{myimage.jpg}}
{{myimage.jpg|this is the alt text for my image}}
[[some link|{{myimage.jpg}}]] - if you click on the image, will goto "some link"
[[http://example.com/|{{myimage.jpg}}]] - same as above: picture links to url
