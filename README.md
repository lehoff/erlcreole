Parser for Wiki Creole 1.0

WARNING: this work was done in 2009 - no clue if it still works, but
putting in on github to share with others as an example of what
Neotoma can be used for.

The grammar has to be tried with the newest version of Neotoma and it
also has to be updated to WikiCreole v1.1.

The test code has to be 100% reworked.

You have been warned ;-)
